# Number Guessing Game
### - A game in which the program takes your name and a range of values. It then generates a random number between your values and you attempt to guess the answer.
### - This program has also had an additional scoreboard feature added in which it will read a JSON file, write to the file your username and score and then save the file for future users of the game. 


## All of these projects utilise original design and programming code. Please feel free to take any concepts used here and add them to your own projects.
