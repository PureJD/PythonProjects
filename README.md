# Number Guessing Game
### - A game in which the program takes your name and a range of values. It then generates a random number between your values and you attempt to guess the answer.
### - This program has also had an additional scoreboard feature added in which it will read a JSON file, write to the file your username and score and then save the file for future users of the game. 

# To Do List
### - A simple program that will allow the user to build a to do list, delete entries and view the list.
### - This program utilises dictionaries and editing entries within them. The program has been arranged into functions and will check user input to ensure the requests are within the parameters of the information required prior to continuing. 

## All of these projects utilise original design and programming code. Please feel free to take any concepts used here and add them to your own projects.
